2) The web page is responsive :
I added <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> in the head
I expressed length almost entirely in cm, vw, vh or % (I used px only for border width)
The css adapt to the width of the screen using @media screen and (max-width: _ )

3) b) To make the webpage work on different browsers, I had to use prefixes like -webkit- or -moz-
in the CSS. I used the tool http://pleeease.iamvdo.me/play/ to help me with it.
